When the page loads, it loads 12 components to the screen each containing a different image from the hit-series Breaking Bad. The app track's the user's score for each picture they click on without repeating the same choice. The highest possible score is 12. Each image is listening for a click event to determine if that is an additional point or if it is game over and the user has to restart.
